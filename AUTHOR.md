## 🌟 Why This Project?

The **IndexedDB Cache System** was developed from real-world needs across multiple production platforms:

- **PaymentHooks.com** needed efficient API caching for billing data
- **OneSync.in** required offline-capable data storage
- **360Classifieds.in** benefited from reducing API calls
- **WorldPostalLocations.com** needed smart caching for API responses

After implementing similar solutions across these platforms, I decided to open-source a generalized, enterprise-grade version that any developer can use.
